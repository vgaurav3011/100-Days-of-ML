    "**Answer:** \n",
    "- I experimented with the hyperparameters and observed different scenarios. Learning from the content, the dimensions for the typical layers were given from 100-300. For exact tuning, I referred to the blog:\n",
    "https://towardsdatascience.com/choosing-the-right-hyperparameters-for-a-simple-lstm-using-keras-f8e9ed76f046\n",
    "\n",
    "- I particularly loved this post: https://blog.floydhub.com/guide-to-hyperparameters-search-for-deep-learning-models/\n",
    "\n",
    "- It was about hyperparameter in general but its emphasis on preventing any overfitting or underfitting in the model was great. I tried a learning rate of 0.01 initially however turned out the loss saturated just after 4 epochs and my best understanding of the situation was that the model was jumping quite quickly in the gradient descent and thus these large jumps were at cost of missing many features that hold significance for predicting patterns.\n",
    "- A learning rate of 0.0001 became too low and the model was converging slowly but provided that we had to wait more patiently for the loss to minimize. I tried with sequence length of 25 initially and the loss was high nearly starting from 11 and coming towars 7 to maximum of 6.2. So, my understanding was that we need to have lesser number of sequences to identify patterns more accurately as the model seemed in a hurry to predict it and led to huge loss values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- So, I tried with 15, 20 and 10 sequence lengths and everytime the loss decreased so finally I decided to keep it minimal enough and took 5 so that atleast we can identify patterns more correctly than rushing to a large value and spoiling the aim of the training. The sequence length of 10 noted good patterns too with loss minimizing upto 3.7. \n",
    "\n",
    "- With 250 hidden layers, I do not think that there was a problem in minimizing loss due to less number of layers for processing the sequence. Ofcourse, the idea of a cyclic learning rate can be used to further minimize the loss by making use of optimized learning rate at the correct timing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally with a learning rate of 0.001 and 5 sequences with batch size of 128 I was able to minimize the loss below 3.5! Also, batch size also affects the training process with larger batch sizes accelerating the time of training but at the cost of loss and too small batch size took huge training time! If used less than 128, the model was converging at only a little better loss and hence, as a tradeoff 128 did not seem to be a bad batch size for training but I do recommend 64 too!"
